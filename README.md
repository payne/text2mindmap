# Text2MindMap
An online tool for making mindmaps by writing indented lists.

A few months ago one of my favorite tools [Text2MindMap](http://www.text2mindmap.com) went down and since there doesn't seem to be any plans to bring it back up I created my own version of the site. It's basically just a quick mashup between some of the code from the original site and some code from my [Markdown Editor](https://tobloef.com/markant/), but I hope someone will find it as useful.
